# Instrumentation Snapshot

openmanetd can periodically capture a JSON "snapshot" of every runtime
counter and metric it maintains and write it to disk. An operator can
pull the latest file off a device to troubleshoot audio glitches, goroutine
leaks, jitter buffer pressure, and other runtime issues — or hand the file
directly to an LLM for triage.

This document is the field reference for the snapshot format. The
authoritative schema is the Go type `internal/instrumentation.Envelope`;
this markdown is the human- and LLM-readable companion. Field names here
match the JSON keys exactly.

## Enabling snapshots

Set the following keys in `/etc/openmanetd/config.yml` and restart the
daemon:

```yaml
instrumentation:
  enable: true          # start the periodic worker at boot (default: false)
  intervalSecs: 60      # capture period in seconds (default: 60)
  snapshotDir: /tmp     # directory the worker writes snapshot files into
```

When `enable` is `false` (the default) the snapshot worker is never
started, the registry is not constructed, and the daemon pays no runtime
cost beyond a handful of function pointers.

When enabled, the worker writes one file per tick named
`openmanetd-snapshot-<unix-nanos>.json`. The first snapshot is written
immediately at daemon boot so operators don't have to wait a full interval.

**The worker does not rotate or clean up old files.** `/tmp` on most
OpenMANET target devices is a tmpfs mount, so unbounded snapshot
accumulation consumes RAM. Pick an interval that matches your deployment
(e.g. 300 for once-per-five-minutes on a node left to run overnight) and
clean up old files manually when you're done capturing.

## Top-level envelope

Every snapshot is a single JSON object with this shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.8.0",
  "captured_at_start": "2026-04-09T12:34:56.789012345Z",
  "captured_at_end":   "2026-04-09T12:34:56.789013101Z",
  "daemon": { ... },
  "runtime": { ... },
  "sections": [
    { "name": "comms",       "data": { ... } },
    { "name": "blos",        "data": { ... } },
    { "name": "sysupgrade",  "data": { ... } },
    { "name": "audio_mixer", "data": { ... } },
    { "name": "wireless",    "data": { ... } },
    { "name": "hardware",    "data": { ... } }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | string | Semver of the envelope schema. Bump minor for additive fields, major for breaking changes. The current value is `1.8.0`. |
| `captured_at_start` | RFC3339 timestamp | Wall-clock time when the capture loop began reading counters. |
| `captured_at_end` | RFC3339 timestamp | Wall-clock time when the capture loop finished. The difference `captured_at_end - captured_at_start` bounds the counter-read skew window; in practice this is microseconds, but it can stretch into milliseconds when the `wireless` section's cache is cold (the first `Refresh` after the 5 s TTL walks netlink under the registry mutex). |
| `daemon.version` | string | openmanetd build version. Empty until the build system populates it. |
| `daemon.hostname` | string | The result of `os.Hostname()` at daemon startup. |
| `daemon.pid` | int | Unix process ID. |
| `daemon.started_at` | RFC3339 timestamp | When the instrumentation registry was constructed (approximately daemon startup). |
| `runtime` | object | Go runtime stats. See **Runtime** below. |
| `sections` | array of `{name, data}` | Per-subsystem counter payloads. See **Sections** below. |

## Runtime

Go runtime statistics collected via `runtime.ReadMemStats` and
`runtime.NumGoroutine`. A rising `num_goroutine` across successive
snapshots typically indicates a goroutine leak; cross-reference with
`/debug/pprof/goroutine` if pprof is enabled.

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `num_goroutine` | int | count | Total live goroutines at capture time. |
| `mem_alloc_bytes` | uint64 | bytes | Bytes of allocated heap objects (same as `runtime.MemStats.Alloc`). |
| `mem_sys_bytes` | uint64 | bytes | Total memory obtained from the OS. |
| `heap_inuse_bytes` | uint64 | bytes | Bytes in in-use spans. |
| `stack_inuse_bytes` | uint64 | bytes | Bytes used by stack spans. |
| `num_gc` | uint32 | count | Number of completed GC cycles since process start. |
| `last_gc_unix_nano` | int64 | unix-nanoseconds | Time of the most recent GC cycle, 0 if none. |
| `gc_pause_last_ns` | uint64 | nanoseconds | Duration of the most recent GC stop-the-world pause. |

## Sections

Each section is `{ "name": "<producer>", "data": <producer-defined> }`.
A producer is a named subsystem in the daemon; the snapshot framework
makes no assumptions about the shape of its `data`. Sections are
documented below in the order they are registered.

### `comms` — audio and RTP pipeline

The comms subsystem owns multicast audio over RTP with Opus encoding.
Counters are updated from real-time audio threads via `sync/atomic`,
so reading them does not stall the TX or RX paths.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "broadcasting": false,
  "remote_rx_active": false,
  "control_source": "openvlm",
  "active_talkgroup": 2,
  "talkgroup_events_dropped": 0,
  "broadcast_encoder": { ... },
  "web_bridge": { ... },
  "fec_adapter": { ... },
  "announcer": { ... },
  "gpio_selector": { ... },
  "device_binding": { ... },
  "ports": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` when the comms runtime is published. When `false`, every other field in this section is zero by construction and should be read as "subsystem off", not "subsystem broken". |
| `broadcasting` | bool | `true` when the TX gate is currently open (mid-PTT). |
| `remote_rx_active` | bool | `true` when the half-duplex cache reports a remote packet was received recently; TX is blocked while this is set. |
| `control_source` | string | Active PTT control source: `openvlm`, `nanoptt`, `web`, or `roip`. |
| `active_talkgroup` | int | 1-based talk group currently active; 0 = never selected or comms down. See **comms.talkgroup** below. |
| `talkgroup_events_dropped` | uint64 | Talk group events shed by bounded-buffer stream subscribers. See **comms.talkgroup** below. |
| `broadcast_encoder` | object | TX-side audio encoder counters. |
| `web_bridge` | object | Web-mode RX bridge counters. |
| `fec_adapter` | object | Adaptive Opus FEC control-loop state. See **comms.fec_adapter** below. |
| `announcer` | object | Voice-announcement player counters. See **comms.talkgroup** below. |
| `gpio_selector` | object | Hardware talk group selector counters. See **comms.talkgroup** below. |
| `device_binding` | object | Which CM108/OpenVLM USB device the HID (PTT) and ALSA (audio, mixer) paths are paired to. See **comms.device_binding** below. |
| `ports` | array | Per-talk-group counters. |

#### `comms.broadcast_encoder`

**All counters are scoped to the current PTT cycle and reset on
`SetTxEnabled(true)`.** A snapshot taken when `tx_enabled == false`
reflects the most recent completed cycle, not a cumulative lifetime.

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `frames_captured` | count | Audio frames delivered by the capture callback. Expected rate: 50/sec at a 20 ms frame cadence. |
| `frames_dropped` | count | Captured frames the audio callback could not hand off to the encode goroutine because the encode channel was full. **Any non-zero value during active TX means the encode loop is behind.** |
| `frames_encoded` | count | Successfully Opus-encoded and forwarded frames. In a healthy cycle `frames_encoded ≈ frames_captured - frames_dropped`. |
| `encode_errors` | count | Opus `EncodeS16` failures. Should stay at 0. |
| `capture_gap_max_ns` | nanoseconds | Maximum observed inter-arrival gap between successive capture callbacks. Values substantially larger than 20,000,000 (20 ms) indicate audio-thread preemption. |
| `capture_late_count` | count | Number of capture callbacks whose arrival was late relative to the previous callback. |
| `encode_dur_max_ns` | nanoseconds | Maximum single-frame encode duration in the current cycle. Compare to the 20,000,000 ns frame budget — values near the budget imply a hot CPU. |
| `encode_dur_sum_ns` | nanoseconds | Sum of encode durations. |
| `encode_dur_count` | count | Number of encode durations summed. Use `encode_dur_sum_ns / encode_dur_count` for the mean. |
| `last_capture_ns` | unix-nanoseconds | Timestamp of the most recent capture callback. 0 means no callback since the last gate reset. |
| `tx_enabled` | bool | Reflects the `txEnabled` atomic gate. When `false` the encoder pipeline is dormant. |
| `over_budget_warned` | bool | Set the first time the encoder observes an encode duration that exceeds the 20 ms frame budget in the current cycle. |

#### `comms.web_bridge`

Counts frames flowing from the per-port jitter buffer into the web-mode
audio bridge that ships them to browser clients.

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `rx_push_in` | count | Monotonic count of frames offered to the bridge (every `PushRxFrame` invocation). Frames only reach the bridge while at least one consumer is attached — see `rx_gated_no_consumer`. |
| `rx_push_drop` | count | Monotonic count of frames discarded by the bridge: the *oldest* queued frame evicted when the ~200 ms channel is full (drop-oldest — the consumer resumes on fresh audio, never more than ~200 ms behind live), plus any stale frames flushed when the first consumer attaches. Compute `rx_push_drop / rx_push_in` — sustained ratios above ~1% mean the browser client is not draining RX fast enough. |
| `rx_gated_no_consumer` | count | Monotonic count of frames the playout drain discarded without offering to the bridge because no RPC stream was attached. Rising while `consumers` is 0 is normal idle web mode (an unattended node receiving traffic), not loss. |
| `consumers` | gauge | Number of `StreamAudioRx` RPC streams currently attached. When 0, `rx_push_in` stops advancing by design and `rx_gated_no_consumer` advances instead. |

#### `comms.fec_adapter`

Adaptive Opus FEC control loop. A single damped goroutine reads the
per-port `jitter.gap_runs_*` histogram every 2 s, maintains an EWMA
estimate of the channel loss ratio, and writes the Opus encoder's
packet-loss percentage to one of three levels (20, 30, 40) subject to
an operator-configured floor. The assumption is that this node's RX
loss is a good proxy for its own TX loss (true on omnidirectional
mesh links), so no inter-node feedback protocol is needed. See
`internal/comms/fec_adapter.go` for the state machine.

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `current_level` | perc (0-100) | The `packetLossPerc` the Opus encoder is currently set to. Always one of { `floor`, 30, 40 }. |
| `loss_ewma` | ratio (0.0-1.0) | The exponentially-weighted moving average of the observed loss ratio the controller is acting on. α = 0.2 at 2 s ticks gives a ~10 s response time. |
| `last_change_unix_nano` | unix-nanoseconds | Wall-clock timestamp of the most recent level change; 0 until the adapter has moved off its initial level. |
| `transitions` | count | Monotonic count of level changes since the adapter started. Rising rapidly means the network is flapping and the hysteresis bands may need widening. |
| `write_errors` | count | Monotonic count of `SetPacketLossPerc` calls that the Opus encoder rejected. Should stay at 0 in production; non-zero means something is wrong with the encoder state. |
| `floor` | perc (0-100) | The operator-configured lower bound from `comms.packetLossPerc`. The adapter will never drop below this value; it is also the initial level at startup. |

#### `comms.talkgroup` — selection, announcer, and hardware selector

Exclusive talk group selection (`SelectTalkGroup`, RPC- or hardware-driven),
the voice-announcement player that reads selection changes back to the
operator, and the Raven 5-position GPIO selector. `announcer` and
`gpio_selector` read as all-zero when the corresponding subsystem isn't
wired in (web mode for the announcer, a non-Raven board or
`comms.gpioSelector.enable: false` for the selector) — zero here means
"not present", not "broken".

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `active_talkgroup` | channel number | 1-based talk group currently active; 0 = never selected or comms down. |
| `talkgroup_events_dropped` | count | Talk group events shed by bounded-buffer stream subscribers. A rising value with an active `StreamTalkGroupEvents` client means that client reads too slowly. |
| `announcer.plays` | count | Voice announcement playbacks started since comms start. |
| `announcer.frame_drops` | count | Announcement frames refused by a full playback buffer. |
| `gpio_selector.transitions` | count | Accepted hardware selector position changes. **Includes the one boot-time selection** — the selector emits the initial switch position at start, which counts as a transition, so a fresh daemon shows `transitions >= 1` even before the operator has touched the switch. |
| `gpio_selector.held_glitches` | count | Selector edge wakeups where zero or multiple pins were active and the previous selection was held. |

#### `comms.device_binding`

The process-wide device binder picks one CM108-family USB device and takes
both its hidraw node and its ALSA card from the same USB parent, so PTT and
audio cannot end up on two different devices. Ranking: the card named by an
operator `ALSA_CARD` override, then GPIO1-strapped OpenVLM devices, then a
generic CM108 (only when every identity probe answered); ties go to the
lowest USB path. The binding is sticky while that USB parent stays present,
is released when the OpenVLM HID reader loses the device, and is redone on
replug. Filled for the `openvlm` and `roip` control sources; for others
every field is zero except `alsa_card`, which is -1.

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bound` | bool | `true` while a device is bound. |
| `sys_path` | string | USB parent of the bound device under `/sys` (e.g. `bus/usb/devices/1-1.3`, the hub port). Empty when unbound. |
| `hid_path` | string | hidraw node read for PTT/volume buttons (e.g. `/dev/hidraw2`). |
| `serial` | string | USB serial of the bound device; may be empty on stock parts. |
| `alsa_card` | int | ALSA card index used for capture, playback and mixer. -1 when unbound. |
| `candidates` | count | CM108-family devices seen at the last bind. |
| `openvlm` | bool | `true` when the bound device's GPIO1 strap read high (a real OpenVLM). `false` with `bound: true` means a generic CM108 fallback. |
| `ambiguous` | bool | `true` when another device ranked equally (e.g. two OpenVLMs); the lowest USB path won. |
| `card_override` | bool | `true` when `ALSA_CARD` was set by the operator before startup; the binder then never writes or clears it and local audio does not follow rebinds. |
| `binds` | count | Binding changes since daemon start: first bind, rebind after replug, or hidraw/card renumbering on the same port. |
| `losses` | count | Bound devices that disappeared (HID read failure or absent at rescan). |
| `bind_failures` | count | Bind attempts that found no usable device (none present, children still enumerating, or an identity probe failed). |

#### `comms.ports[*]`

One entry per configured multicast talk group. The slice order mirrors
`CommsRuntime.Ports`.

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `address` | string | Multicast group address (e.g. `239.0.0.1`). |
| `port` | int | UDP port. |
| `qos_dscp` | int (0-63) | DSCP the kernel actually holds on this port's RTP sender socket, read back once at socket build time (RTCP carries the same marking). 46 = EF (default, WMM AC_VI on the mesh), 48 = CS6 (AC_VO). 0 = unmarked: `comms.dscp: 0`, a receive-only port, or a marking failure — see the QoS heuristic below. |
| `qos_so_priority` | int | Kernel `SO_PRIORITY` read-back for the same socket. `256 + qos_dscp>>3` (e.g. 261 for EF) when fully applied — the 802.1d passthrough range that pins the WMM access class on the first hop. A value of 0-6 with a nonzero `qos_dscp` means the `SO_PRIORITY` setsockopt failed (missing CAP_NET_ADMIN) and the socket runs TOS-only; batman-adv still derives the class from the IP header on every hop. |
| `send_enabled` | bool | Runtime toggle — if `false`, the TX path skips this talk group. |
| `receive_enabled` | bool | Runtime toggle — if `false`, incoming RTP is not pushed into the jitter buffer. |
| `playback_underruns` | count | Number of playback-side decode failures that had to recover via PLC (packet loss concealment). |
| `rx_pkts` | count | Monotonic count of successful `ReadFromUDP` returns on this port's receive socket (packets the kernel handed userspace). |
| `rx_loopback` | count | Packets dropped by the loopback filter (own-IP suppression) before reaching the RTP parser. |
| `rx_parse_errs` | count | Packets that failed `rtp.ParseIncoming`. Sustained nonzero deltas indicate a non-RTP sender aliasing the port. Only counted while the port is receive-enabled — muted ports discard packets before parsing, so a muted port always shows a zero delta here regardless of traffic. |
| `rx_pushed` | count | Packets that `PushWithSSRC` accepted into the jitter buffer. In a healthy stream, `rx_pushed ≈ rx_pkts - rx_loopback - rx_parse_errs`. |
| `rx_push_rejected` | count | Packets that `PushWithSSRC` rejected as stale-cursor, duplicate, overflow, or oversized (payload larger than the RFC 6716 1275-byte frame cap — a conforming Opus sender never produces these). A sustained nonzero delta with `jitter.ssrc_resets` flat indicates a consumer-side cursor-advance bug, sender reordering, or a non-Opus sender aliasing the port. |
| `web_popped_skipped` | count | `webPlayoutLoop` observed the jitter buffer advancing past a missing sequence number (only happens when the buffer is half-full of out-of-order packets). Zero on the portaudio playout path. |
| `jitter.overflows` | count | Incoming packets rejected because the jitter buffer was full. Sustained non-zero deltas across snapshots mean the receiver is behind the sender or the network is bursting. |
| `jitter.ssrc_resets` | count | Mid-stream SSRC transitions the jitter buffer handled by resetting. High values (multiple per minute) suggest multiple talkers or sender restarts. |
| `jitter.idle_resets` | count | Gap-driven buffer resets (same SSRC, silence longer than the idle threshold). |
| `jitter.gap_runs_1` | count | Contiguous sequence-gap runs of length 1 frame (~20 ms) observed at the jitter buffer's skip-missing branch. Each run is counted exactly once at the skip point, not once per skipped frame. |
| `jitter.gap_runs_2_5` | count | Gap runs of 2–5 frames (40–100 ms). |
| `jitter.gap_runs_6_10` | count | Gap runs of 6–10 frames (120–200 ms). |
| `jitter.gap_runs_11_20` | count | Gap runs of 11–20 frames (220–400 ms). |
| `jitter.gap_runs_21_50` | count | Gap runs of 21–50 frames (420 ms–1 s). Runs longer than 31 cannot occur at the current `MaxDepth` of 32. |
| `jitter.gap_runs_over_50` | count | Gap runs of 51+ frames (>1 s). Will only fire if `MaxDepth` is raised above 50. |
| `rx_gate.last_mark_unix_nano` | unix-nanoseconds | Timestamp of the most recent Mark call; 0 = never marked. |
| `rx_gate.threshold_ns` | nanoseconds | Half-duplex receive window. Default is 400 ms. |
| `rx_gate.active` | bool | `true` iff `last_mark_unix_nano` is within `threshold_ns` of now. |

### `blos` — BLOS / Tailscale overlay

```json
{
  "running": true,
  "connected_since_unix_ns": 1713614400000000000,
  "backend_state": "Running",
  "peer_count": 4,
  "rx_bytes_total": 1048576,
  "tx_bytes_total": 524288,
  "rx_bps_60s": 1234.5,
  "tx_bps_60s": 678.9,
  "events_dropped": 0
}
```

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `running` | bool | — | `true` when the BLOS manager reports the Tailscale overlay is active. `false` covers both "disabled by config" and "enabled but stopped". |
| `connected_since_unix_ns` | int64 | unix-nanoseconds | Wall-clock time of the first transition to BackendState="Running" in the current enable cycle. 0 when the backend has not reached Running since the last enable. Subtract from `captured_at_start` to compute uptime. |
| `backend_state` | string | — | Mirrors the Tailscale backend state at snapshot time: one of `NoState`, `NeedsLogin`, `NeedsMachineAuth`, `Stopped`, `Starting`, `Running`. Empty when the status worker has never produced a reading. |
| `peer_count` | uint32 | count | Number of Tailscale peers visible to the local node at snapshot time (len of `status.Peer`). |
| `rx_bytes_total` | uint64 | bytes | Sum of `PeerStatus.RxBytes` across all peers — cumulative bytes received since `tailscaled` last started. |
| `tx_bytes_total` | uint64 | bytes | Sum of `PeerStatus.TxBytes` across all peers. |
| `rx_bps_60s` | float64 | bytes/sec | RX rate averaged over the last 60 seconds of samples held by the status worker's rate ring. Zero until the ring has at least two samples. |
| `tx_bps_60s` | float64 | bytes/sec | TX rate averaged over the same 60-second window. |
| `events_dropped` | uint64 | count | Cumulative count of BLOS stream events the daemon dropped because a registered listener's bounded channel was full. A non-zero-and-growing value across successive snapshots indicates a slow consumer of the `StreamBLOSEvents` RPC. |

### `sysupgrade` — firmware upgrade manager

```json
{
  "phase": "idle",
  "last_error": "",
  "current_release_tag": "",
  "current_asset_name": "",
  "capable_reason": "ok",
  "last_check_unix": 1745596800,
  "downloaded_bytes": 0,
  "total_bytes": 0,
  "child_pid": 0,
  "in_progress": false,
  "capable": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `phase` | string | — | Current high-level state: `idle`, `checking`, `downloading`, `verifying`, `ready`, `upgrading`, `failed`, or `unspecified` (only on the zero value). |
| `last_error` | string | — | Most recent error message; empty on the happy path. Populated when `phase` is `failed` or after a transient `checking` failure. |
| `current_release_tag` | string | — | Release tag currently being downloaded/installed, e.g. `v1.8.0`. Empty when no upgrade is in flight. |
| `current_asset_name` | string | — | Asset filename of the in-flight upgrade, e.g. the matching sysupgrade image. Empty when no upgrade is in flight. |
| `capable_reason` | string | — | Short human-readable reason corresponding to `capable`: `ok`, `no /sbin/sysupgrade`, `rootfs is ext4, not squashfs`, `no /overlay mount`, etc. |
| `last_check_unix` | int64 | unix-seconds | Wall-clock time of the most recent successful github fetch, or 0 if the daemon has not contacted github in the current run and the on-disk cache is empty. |
| `downloaded_bytes` | int64 | bytes | Bytes written to the destination file so far during a download. Resets to 0 when the manager returns to `idle`. |
| `total_bytes` | int64 | bytes | Expected size of the asset being downloaded. -1/0 when not yet known. |
| `child_pid` | int32 | pid | PID of the detached sysupgrade child once it has been launched via setsid+nohup. 0 before the runner returns; once non-zero the daemon has handed off control. |
| `in_progress` | bool | — | True while a per-upgrade goroutine or detached sysupgrade child is alive. Useful as a one-field check before deciding whether `phase` is meaningful. |
| `capable` | bool | — | True when all sysupgrade preconditions are satisfied (binary present, squashfs root, /overlay mounted). |

### `audio_mixer` — hardware mixer cache

Last daemon-side reading of the sound card's ALSA mixer (speaker/mic
volume, AGC), cached atomically on every startup apply, `GetAudioMixer`,
and `UpdateAudioMixer`. This is a cache, not live hardware: changes made
out-of-band (alsamixer, VOL+/VOL− buttons) appear only after the next API
read.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `speaker_volume_pct` | int | Last known playback volume percent (0–100). -1 = never read or control absent. |
| `mic_volume_pct` | int | Last known capture volume percent (0–100). -1 = never read or control absent. |
| `agc_known` | bool | Whether the Auto Gain Control switch has been observed at all. When false, `agc_enabled` is meaningless. |
| `agc_enabled` | bool | Last known Auto Gain Control state. When true, the CM108B adjusts capture gain itself and manual mic volume changes may appear ineffective. |

### `wireless` — mesh station rates

Every mesh-point wifi interface with the stations the driver currently
knows (`iw station dump` data via nl80211), read through the same
TTL-bounded wireless cache the API handlers use. Values are therefore at
most `DefaultWirelessCacheTTL` (5 s) old, and the netlink refresh that
fills them is shared with — not added to — the API's own polling. The
section is registered only when the mesh management workers are running
(`alfred.enable`); on a daemon without them the section is absent.

```json
{
  "interfaces": [
    {
      "name": "mesh1",
      "stations": [
        {
          "mac": "9c:ef:d5:f9:80:4d",
          "signal_dbm": -61,
          "signal_avg_dbm": -63,
          "tx_bitrate_kbps": 86700,
          "tx_phy": "he",
          "tx_width_mhz": 40,
          "tx_mcs": 7,
          "tx_nss": 2,
          "rx_bitrate_kbps": 72200,
          "rx_phy": "ht",
          "rx_width_mhz": 20,
          "rx_mcs": 7,
          "rx_nss": 1,
          "tx_retries": 12,
          "tx_failed": 3,
          "inactive_ms": 1500
        }
      ]
    },
    { "name": "mesh0", "stations": [] }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `error` | string | — | Present only when the wifi interface list could not be read (nl80211 failure); `interfaces` is then empty. |
| `interfaces[*].name` | string | — | Linux interface name of a mesh-point (802.11s) interface. AP and station interfaces are not listed. |
| `interfaces[*].error` | string | — | Present only when the station dump for this interface failed; `stations` is then empty and the other interfaces are still reported. |
| `interfaces[*].stations[*].mac` | string | — | Peer MAC, lowercase colon-separated. Empty when the driver returned an address that is not 6 bytes. |
| `…stations[*].signal_dbm` | int32 | dBm | Signal of the last received PPDU from this peer (`NL80211_STA_INFO_SIGNAL`). |
| `…stations[*].signal_avg_dbm` | int32 | dBm | Driver-averaged signal (`NL80211_STA_INFO_SIGNAL_AVG`); the value the mesh admission floor (`mesh_rssi_threshold`) is compared against. |
| `…stations[*].tx_bitrate_kbps` | int32 | kbit/s | Rate the local radio last transmitted to this peer with. When the driver reports no rate attributes this is the plain station bitrate and `tx_phy` is empty. |
| `…stations[*].tx_phy` | string | — | Modulation family of the TX rate: `legacy` (802.11a/b/g), `ht` (n), `vht` (ac), `he` (ax), `eht` (be), or `""` when unknown. S1G/HaLow rates report width 1–16 with `legacy` or `ht` depending on which attributes the driver emits; `mcs` is −1 until the parser learns the S1G attributes. |

### `hardware` — V1 radio power, recovery and battery

The Ghostnet V1 hardware manager (`internal/hardware`): per-radio power
state machine, bounded recovery ladder, fault input edges, supervisor
watchdog and INA228 battery telemetry. `Refresh` copies the manager's last
published status under its mutex; it does no I/O. The section is
registered only when `hardware.enable` is true (the default). On a board
that is not a V1, or while `hardware.actuationEnable` is false (the
default until the pin map is verified on hardware), `control_mode` is
`telemetry_only` and every radio reports `unmanaged`.

| Field | Type | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `control_mode` | string | — | `active` when the manager drives GPIO and bus controls, `telemetry_only` when it drives nothing. Telemetry-only causes: board not detected, `hardware.actuationEnable` false, a required GPIO line name missing, or the boot-loop guard (see `recovery_boots_last_hour`). |
| `radios[*].name` | string | — | `halow` (USB, first) or `wifi` (PCIe). |
| `radios[*].state` | string | — | Power state machine state: `unmanaged`, `off`, `powering`, `enumerating`, `up`, `fault`, `cooldown`, `failed`. `failed` means the recovery ladder is exhausted and the radio stays off until an operator runs `ExecuteRadioRecovery`. |
| `radios[*].state_since_ns` | int64 | unix-nanoseconds | When the radio entered `state`; 0 when unknown. |
| `radios[*].recoveries_total` | uint64 | count | Recovery ladder steps (device reset, hub reset, power cycle) run on this radio since the daemon started. |
| `radios[*].power_cycles_total` | uint64 | count | Ladder power cycles of this radio since the daemon started (at most 3 per incident before `failed`). |
| `radios[*].failed_total` | uint64 | count | Entries into `failed` since the daemon started. |
| `fault_edges_total.halow_fault_n` | uint64 | count | Edges seen on HALOW_FAULT_N (HaLow load switch fault) since start. Stays 0 when the input is not listed in `hardware.faultInputs`. |
| `fault_edges_total.wifi_fault_n` | uint64 | count | Edges on WIFI_FAULT_N (Wi-Fi load switch fault). |
| `fault_edges_total.power_good` | uint64 | count | Edges on POWER_GOOD (system rail good). |
| `fault_edges_total.efuse_fault` | uint64 | count | Edges on EFUSE_FAULT (input eFuse fault). |
| `fault_edges_total.halow_usb_fault_n` | uint64 | count | Edges on the HaLow USB port over-current flag. |
| `fault_edges_total.vlm_usb_fault_n` | uint64 | count | Edges on the OpenVLM USB port over-current flag. |
| `fault_edges_total.ina228_alert_n` | uint64 | count | Edges on the INA228 ALERT output. |
| `fault_edges_total.supervisor_wdo` | uint64 | count | Edges on the supervisor WDO output (watchdog timeout). Same value as `wdo_edges_total`. |
| `watchdog_pets_total` | uint64 | count | Heartbeats written to the supervisor gpio-wdt since start. Stays 0 while `hardware.watchdogEnable` is false. |
| `wdo_edges_total` | uint64 | count | Supervisor WDO edges since start; a rising value means the supervisor saw missed heartbeats. |
| `battery_bus_mv` | int32 | millivolts | Last bus voltage read from the INA228 (`in1_input`). Last good value is kept while stale. |
| `battery_current_ma` | int32 | milliamps | Last system current (`curr1_input`); positive is draw from the pack. |
| `recovery_boots_last_hour` | uint32 | count | Software-requested host resets recorded in the persisted boot-loop guard during the last hour. 3 or more puts this boot in `telemetry_only`. |
| `board_detected` | bool | — | True when board.json identifies a Ghostnet V1 carrier. |
| `battery_stale` | bool | — | True when the newest battery reading is older than 5 s or there is none (monitor absent or unreachable). The two `battery_*` values are then not current. |

## Interpretation heuristics for LLM triage

When a snapshot is provided for analysis, apply the following rules of
thumb in order and flag anything that fits.

1. **Encoder behind the budget.** If `comms.enabled` is true and
   `comms.broadcast_encoder.frames_dropped > 0` while
   `comms.broadcast_encoder.tx_enabled` is true, the encode goroutine
   cannot keep up with the 20 ms per-frame budget. Check
   `encode_dur_max_ns` against `20_000_000`. If close or over, the
   daemon is CPU-bound; if well under, the drop is from a transient
   scheduling stall on the encode goroutine.
2. **Capture thread preemption.** `comms.broadcast_encoder.capture_late_count > 0`
   or `capture_gap_max_ns ≫ 20_000_000` means the audio callback thread is
   being preempted. Look for CPU spikes or co-scheduled work.
3. **Mean encode time.** Compute `encode_dur_sum_ns / encode_dur_count`.
   A mean above ~5 ms on a full-sized device is a warning; above ~10 ms
   is a red flag.
4. **Jitter buffer pressure.** `comms.ports[*].jitter.overflows > 0`
   sustained across two snapshots means the receiver is dropping frames
   — either the sender is too fast or the network is bursting.
5. **SSRC churn.** `ssrc_resets` increasing by more than ~1 per minute
   suggests multiple talkers or a sender restart.
6. **Web RX starvation.** `rx_push_drop / rx_push_in > 1%` across two
   snapshots means the browser client is not draining received audio
   fast enough.
7. **Goroutine leak.** `runtime.num_goroutine` rising monotonically
   across successive snapshots is almost always a leak. Cross-reference
   with `/debug/pprof/goroutine` if pprof is enabled.
8. **GC pressure.** `runtime.gc_pause_last_ns > 20_000_000` (20 ms)
   means the most recent GC pause straddled an audio frame boundary and
   may have caused a stutter.
9. **RX push rejection.** `comms.ports[*].rx_push_rejected` increasing
   across two snapshots while `jitter.ssrc_resets` and `jitter.idle_resets`
   stay flat means packets are being rejected by the jitter buffer as
   stale-cursor — typically a sign of a consumer-side cursor-advance bug
   or severe sender reordering. Cross-reference with
   `comms.ports[*].rx_pkts` (did the kernel actually deliver the packets?)
   and `comms.ports[*].web_popped_skipped` (did `webPlayoutLoop` advance
   the cursor past a gap?).
10. **RX loss topology.** The `jitter.gap_runs_*` buckets distinguish
    isolated packet loss from contiguous burst loss. A distribution
    weighted in `gap_runs_1` and `gap_runs_2_5` indicates short,
    recoverable losses — Opus in-band FEC (LBRR) and RFC 2198-style
    redundant payloads can mitigate these. A distribution weighted in
    `gap_runs_11_20` and higher indicates long contiguous bursts
    (>200 ms) that no bounded-latency FEC scheme can recover; this is
    typical of WiFi broadcast/multicast on interference-prone links
    and usually means the mitigation has to be masking (longer jitter
    buffer, PLC) rather than recovery. Always read these buckets
    alongside `rx_pkts` so you know the absolute scale. **Note:** the
    FEC adapter (see `comms.fec_adapter`) already consumes these
    buckets every 2 s and raises `packet_loss_perc` in response —
    operator action is only needed when the adapter has hit its
    ceiling (level 40) and loss still persists.
11. **FEC adapter pegged at max.** `comms.fec_adapter.current_level
    == 40` sustained across multiple snapshots with a non-zero
    `transitions` count means the controller has raised the level
    and has not been able to drop it back down. Cross-reference
    `comms.ports[*].jitter.gap_runs_*`: if the higher-length buckets
    (`11_20`, `21_50`, `over_50`) are contributing most of the loss,
    the controller is doing the right thing but FEC has hit its
    useful ceiling — consider widening the jitter buffer or
    diagnosing the RF environment. If only the short buckets (`1`,
    `2_5`) are contributing, the controller is behaving correctly
    for a lossy-but-recoverable channel and the level will track the
    real loss rate. A non-zero `comms.fec_adapter.write_errors`
    delta across snapshots means the encoder rejected a
    `SetPacketLossPerc` call — that should never happen in production
    and indicates the codec is in a bad state.
12. **Comms disabled but expected.** If the user reports a broken PTT
   workflow but `comms.enabled == false`, the subsystem was either
   disabled in config or failed to start. Check daemon logs for the
   corresponding startup error.
13. **Sysupgrade hung.** `sysupgrade.phase == "upgrading"` and
   `sysupgrade.child_pid > 0` mean the runner has detached the
   sysupgrade child and the daemon is waiting on a reboot. If the
   snapshot worker is still emitting captures with the same PID
   minutes later, the device did not reboot — check the per-asset
   log file under `/tmp/openmanetd/sysupgrade/<asset>.log` on the
   device. `phase == "failed"` with `last_error` mentioning
   `checksum` means the GitHub asset is corrupted or the wrong file
   was matched; `last_error` mentioning `insufficient` indicates
   `/tmp` ran out of space (a 50 MiB image on a 256 MiB tmpfs is
   tight). Cross-reference `sysupgrade.capable` and
   `sysupgrade.capable_reason` to confirm the device should ever
   have been able to flash in the first place.
14. **Voice QoS marking state.** For every Send-enabled port,
   `comms.ports[*].qos_dscp` should equal the configured `comms.dscp`
   (default 46) and `qos_so_priority` should equal `256 + qos_dscp>>3`
   (261 at the default). `qos_dscp == 0` on a Send-enabled port while
   `comms.dscp` is nonzero means the marking setsockopt failed at
   startup — voice is riding best-effort; check daemon logs for
   "QoS marking". A nonzero `qos_dscp` with `qos_so_priority` in 0-6
   means TOS-only marking (`SO_PRIORITY` was refused, typically missing
   CAP_NET_ADMIN): batman-adv hops still classify correctly from the IP
   header, but a socket egressing a wlan directly would not. If voice
   latency under load is the complaint and these fields read 0, fix
   marking before tuning anything else — an unmarked voice stream
   queues behind bulk traffic in the WMM best-effort class on every
   hop.
15. **"No audio heard" triage order.** Before suspecting the jitter
   buffer or playback path, check `audio_mixer.speaker_volume_pct` — a
   value at or near 0 means the hardware mixer is turned down. -1 means
   the daemon has never touched the mixer (no `comms.audio` config and
   no API call), so the hardware may be at any level.
16. **"Mic too quiet / too hot" with `agc_enabled: true`.** The CM108B's
   AGC overrides manual capture gain; toggle AGC off via
   `UpdateAudioMixer` before tuning `mic_volume_pct`.
17. **Selector wiring health.** A steadily rising
   `comms.gpio_selector.held_glitches` with flat
   `comms.gpio_selector.transitions` indicates a stuck or miswired
   selector (multiple pins grounded, or a floating line) — the
   operator's switch turns are being ignored. Occasional held-glitches
   during transitions are normal rotary behavior (the wiper bridges two
   contacts briefly as it turns). Cross-check `comms.active_talkgroup`
   against the physical switch position; remember `transitions` starts
   at 1 on a fresh boot (the selector emits the initial position as a
   transition), so `transitions == 1` with zero held-glitches since
   boot is healthy, not stuck.
18. **Announcement audibility.** `comms.announcer.plays` rising with
   `comms.announcer.frame_drops` near zero is healthy. Sustained
   `frame_drops` means the playback buffer is contended — check whether
   the active port's stream is running
   (`comms.ports[*].receive_enabled`).
19. **2.4 GHz link fell back to HT.** On a `mesh1` (batmesh1) station,
   `wireless.interfaces[*].stations[*].tx_phy` of `"ht"` or
   `tx_width_mhz` of 20 while `signal_dbm` is above −70 means the HE40
   configured by setup did not negotiate: the peer lacks HE, the two
   radios disagree on width, or `noscan` is missing on one side. Expect
   roughly a third of the ~100 Mbps ceiling the batmesh1 tuning targets.
   Compare `htmode` on both nodes before touching anything else. A
   `mesh0` (HaLow) station at 1–16 MHz is normal whichever of
   `legacy`/`ht` it reports.
20. **Rate/RSSI mismatch.** `tx_mcs ≤ 2` with `signal_dbm > −70` on an
   `he` or `ht` link means rate control is backing off for interference
   or retries, not distance. Read `tx_retries` and `tx_failed` deltas
   across two snapshots: rising `tx_failed` with a strong signal points
   at a hidden node or a co-channel neighbor, not at range.
21. **Admission floor at work.** A station with `signal_avg_dbm` below
   the configured `mesh_rssi_threshold` (−80 by default) that persists
   across snapshots is a peering that predates the threshold write;
   `inactive_ms` growing without bound means the peer is gone and the
   plink will time out on its own.

22. **Hardware control is off.** `hardware.control_mode` of
   `telemetry_only` with `board_detected` true is the shipped default
   (`hardware.actuationEnable: false`), not a fault. With
   `recovery_boots_last_hour` at 3 or more it is the boot-loop guard:
   the node reset itself repeatedly and recovery is suspended for this
   boot. Read the recovery events (`ListRecoveryEvents`) before
   re-enabling anything.
23. **Radio flapping.** `radios[*].recoveries_total` or
   `power_cycles_total` rising between snapshots while `state` keeps
   returning to `up` means the radio keeps dropping off its bus. Check
   the matching `fault_edges_total` input (`halow_fault_n`,
   `halow_usb_fault_n`, `wifi_fault_n`) and `battery_bus_mv`: a sag
   below about 10500 mV with large `battery_current_ma` points at the
   pack or wiring, not the radio. A radio in `failed` stays off until an
   operator recovers it.
24. **Watchdog not holding.** `wdo_edges_total` rising while
   `watchdog_pets_total` also rises means the heartbeat interval is too
   slow for the supervisor; `wdo_edges_total` rising with
   `watchdog_pets_total` flat means nothing is petting it (watchdog
   disabled or the daemon stalled). `battery_stale` true makes every
   battery inference unreliable.
25. **OpenVLM pairing and replug.** `comms.device_binding.bound: false`
   with `bind_failures` rising means no usable CM108 is attached; local
   mic/speaker stay off on purpose (the daemon never falls back to the
   ALSA default card in `openvlm` mode) while RTP relay keeps running.
   `losses` advancing in step with `binds` is an unplug/replug or USB
   reset cycle; if it keeps climbing with nobody touching the cable,
   suspect the hub port or cable. `bound: true` with `openvlm: false`
   means a generic CM108 headset was chosen because no strapped OpenVLM
   was found. `ambiguous: true` means several equal candidates were
   attached; detach the extra one rather than relying on USB path order.
   With `card_override: true`, `alsa_card` shows the HID device's own
   card, which can differ from the operator's `ALSA_CARD`.

## Skew note

The snapshot framework reads each atomic counter one at a time. Between
the first atomic load and the last, the system keeps running — so
derived values that combine multiple counters (e.g. `encode_dur_sum_ns /
encode_dur_count`) may be off by one frame. The window is bounded
exactly by `captured_at_end - captured_at_start`, typically a few
microseconds — though it can reach milliseconds on a cold `wireless`
cache, where the first `Refresh` after the 5 s TTL walks netlink under
the registry mutex. When comparing deltas across two snapshots, treat values
that moved by less than ~50 as within the skew noise floor.

No producer-side locks are added for capture; this is an explicit
design trade-off to keep the audio hot paths untouched.

## Reusability

The `internal/instrumentation` package is self-contained and imports
only the Go standard library and zerolog. It can be lifted wholesale
into another repository — only the producer-side `Snapshotter` adapters
(in `internal/comms` and `internal/blos`) need to be adapted to the new
domain. See the package GoDoc for the contract.
